This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website, a React application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS. The website is deployed to Netlify for easy access and hosting.


## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/umairayub79/umairayub.codes

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and provide you with a local URL where you can preview the website.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized and minified version of the website in the `dist` directory.
